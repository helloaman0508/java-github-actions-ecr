# java-github-actions-ecr
This repository contains a sample Java Maven application integrated with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow automates the entire build, test, and deployment process — from compiling the Java code to containerizing the application and pushing the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
